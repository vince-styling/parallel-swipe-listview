Parallel-Swipe-ListView
=======================

This project was born to answer this stackoverflow [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946509/how-to-control-viewpages-pages-from-another-page/25968469). We are trying to accomplish an interesting effect which origin from XiaoMi the `Contacts` application.

Sadly, I still can't get it work perfectly. This project is under developing, thus haven't refactor the code. It's a mess for you, don't waste time on it until I make it right.
